## ðŸ”„ Ride Request Flow

The app supports two types of ride booking:

### 1. Instant Booking Rides

- Passengers can join immediately without driver approval
- Seats are allocated on first-come, first-served basis
- Suitable for trusted groups or flexible drivers

### 2. Approval-Based Rides (Default)

- All join requests require driver approval
- Complete notification system for request handling
- Better control for drivers over their passengers

### Complete Flow:

#### For Passengers:

1. **Find Ride**: Browse available rides in the main screen
2. **Join Request**: Click "Request Join" (for approval-based) or "Book Now" (for instant)
3. **Wait for Approval**: For approval-based rides, wait for driver response
4. **Get Notification**: Receive notification when request is accepted/rejected
5. **Join Ride**: Once accepted, passenger is added to the ride

#### For Drivers:

1. **Create Ride**: Use CreateRideScreen with instant booking toggle
2. **Receive Requests**: Get notifications when passengers request to join
3. **Review Requests**: Click notifications to open RequestAcceptanceModal
4. **Accept/Reject**: Make decisions and send notifications to passengers
5. **Manage Ride**: View all passengers in RideDetailsScreen

### Notification System:

- **join_request**: Sent to driver when passenger requests to join
- **request_accepted**: Sent to passenger when driver accepts request
- **request_rejected**: Sent to passenger when driver rejects request
- **ride_updated**: Sent to all participants when ride details change
- **ride_cancelled**: Sent to all participants when ride is cancelled
- **chat_message**: Sent for new chat messages in ride groups

### Database Tables Involved:

- `carpool_rides`: Main ride information
- `join_requests`: Pending and processed join requests
- `ride_passengers`: Confirmed passengers for each ride
- `notifications`: All notification history
- `user_profiles`: User information and ratings

### Testing the Flow:

1. Run `setup-database.sql` in Supabase to create all tables
2. Create a test ride with instant_booking = false
3. From another user account, try to join the ride
4. Check notifications table for the join_request notification
5. As the driver, click the notification and accept/reject
6. Verify passenger gets acceptance/rejection notification
7. Check that passenger is added to ride_passengers table if accepted

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Metro bundler issues:**

```bash
# Clear cache and restart
npx expo start --clear
```

**2. Dependencies not installing:**

```bash
# Delete node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

**3. Expo Go not connecting:**

- Ensure your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network
- Try restarting the Expo development server
- Check firewall settings

**4. TypeScript errors:**

```bash
# Check TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Performance Tips

- Use a physical device for better performance
- Ensure stable WiFi connection
- Close other apps to free up memory
- Use development build for better performance (optional)
